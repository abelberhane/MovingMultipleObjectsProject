# Moving Multiple Objects Project

C# Project that animates multiple objects in a Windows Form. I can use this to animate and populate my games with various pop up messages, 
maybe when they win or during a bonus round. The logic behind it has not been too difficulty however it is new. I was able to reproduce the 2nd and 3rd movement once I got the first one animated. 

I have added a background to the form but it began to induce a lag on the labels. This was an interesting yet simple project. I dont plan to really go back and work on it again but I believe the bug that plagues me in my games may have to do with the background.
