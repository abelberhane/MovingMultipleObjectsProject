# Moving Multiple Objects Project

C# Project that animates multiple objects in a Windows Form. I can use this to animate and populate my games with various pop up messages, 
maybe when they win or during a bonus round. The logic behind it has not been too difficulty however it is new. 

I have pushed what I have done so far but plan on completing this shortly once I have a moment to work on it again.
